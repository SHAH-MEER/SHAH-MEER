## 👋 Hey there, welcome to my GitHub!

I'm glad you're here! I'm a public health graduate turned data scientist 📊, with a growing portfolio in AI, machine learning 🤖, and deep learning. I use Python, PyTorch, and Hugging Face to build smart solutions—ranging from medical GANs and document analyzers to traffic monitoring systems and style transfer apps.  

💼 I’ve worked with organizations like WHO and the Special People Resources Centre, contributing to real-world data collection, analysis, and public health impact. Now, I'm channeling that experience into building tools that blend public health with cutting-edge tech.

### 🔧 What I'm building
- 🧠 AI-powered medical & legal document analyzers (NER, QA, summarization)
- 🚦 Smart traffic monitoring systems with YOLO & Streamlit
- 🎨 Real-time style transfer apps using pre-trained networks
- 🐶 Fine-tuning custom transformers like “Doge” on math reasoning datasets

### 🚀 Tech Stack Highlights
- Python, Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, PyTorch, Hugging Face
- Streamlit, Gradio for app deployment
- PostgreSQL for backend data management
- Deep learning projects using CNNs, Transformers, QLoRA, GANs
