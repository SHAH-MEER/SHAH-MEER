## About Me 👋

Hey there! I'm a public health grad turned data scientist 💡 passionate about using AI to solve **real-world problems**—from healthcare to smart cities.

When I’m not coding or building machine learning apps, you might find me:
- Dreaming up ways to use data for social good 🌱
- Breaking down AI models just to rebuild them better 🔁
- Exploring the perfect balance between public health & machine learning 🧠❤️

## 🧰 Tech Stack: Where the Magic Happens

I’m fluent in Pythonic spells and deep learning alchemy 🔮

### 🧠 Machine Learning / AI
- scikit-learn, XGBoost, LightGBM
- PyTorch, Hugging Face Transformers, QLoRA
- GANs (Medical & Style Transfer), YOLOv8 (Object Detection)

### 🌐 Deployment & Visualization
- Streamlit, Gradio, Dash
- Pandas, Seaborn, Matplotlib
- PostgreSQL, pgAdmin

### 📊 Other Skills
- Public health research & epidemiological analysis
- Data cleaning, NLP, NER, summarization, and QA
- AWS (learning in progress!), Tableau (certification pending)

## ⚙️ Projects: My Digital Lab 🔬

Here’s where I bring ideas to life—one repo at a time:

### 🩺 **Medical Report Analyzer**
AI-powered NLP app for summarizing and extracting key info from medical documents using Hugging Face models.

### 🎨 **Real-Time Style Transfer App**
Feedforward neural network for fast, fun artistic transformations—deployed with Gradio.

### 🚦 **Smart Traffic Monitoring System**
YOLOv8-powered app for real-time vehicle & pedestrian detection. Think city brains on code 🧠🏙️

### 🐶 **"Doge" Transformer**
A custom 160M-parameter model fine-tuned on math reasoning with QLoRA—just for fun (and science).

_(More coming soon!)_

## 🧠 Fun Facts About Me

- I once built a CNN just to see what my cat would look like in Van Gogh style 🎨🐱
- I think epidemiology and machine learning are secretly the same thing—just different feature spaces.
- My favorite Python package? `gradio`—because showing off your model is half the fun!
