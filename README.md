# Welcome to My GitHub Profile! 🌍🚀

## About Me 👋

Hey! I'm a public health grad turned data scientist passionate about **AI for good** — blending public health, machine learning, and generative AI to solve real-world challenges.  

When I’m not modeling data, you’ll catch me:
- Designing AI apps that make impact 🧠📲  
- Reading research papers like thrillers 🕵️‍♂️  
- Wondering if my GAN is dreaming in X-rays 🤯

## 🔥 My Tech Stack — Built Around Projects That Matter

Forget generic lists — here’s what I’ve built and learned along the way:

### 🧠 Large Language Models (LLMs)
**💰 Fine-Tuning LLaMA 3.1 on Amazon Pricing Dataset**  
→ Hands-on with QLoRA, PEFT, and Hugging Face Transformers for domain-specific finetuning.

### 🎨 Generative AI
**🧬 Medical Image GAN (Deployed via Streamlit)**  
→ Built with PyTorch + CNNs to generate synthetic medical scans for augmentation and education.

### 📊 Data Science & ML
**🎬 Movie Recommendation Engine**  
→ Implemented collaborative filtering and content-based methods using `scikit-learn` and `pandas`.

### 👁️ Computer Vision
**🧠 YOLOv11 Brain Tumor Detection**  
→ Real-time object detection and segmentation with a YOLOv8+ inspired pipeline.
